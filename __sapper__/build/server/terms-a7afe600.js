        <dt>2. Description and Purpose of the AMPZ Service</dt>
        <dd>
          2.1. AMPZ acts as an intermediary between the User and the Partners
          and provides a platform on which the User can upload performance
          results, content, and feedback as well as interact with the community
          of Users and Partners.
          <br>
          <br>
          2.2. In exchange, the Partners provide information about offers, news,
          content, special events, trial and scouting opportunities through the
          AMPZ Service
          <br>
          <br>
          2.3. A User may create a profile as either a player, a coach, or a
          scout depending on their involvement in sports into which they will
          then input relevant data.
          <br>
          <br>
          2.4. The objective of providing AMPZ with this data is to help Users
          to track, and progress through their sports career or the career of
          others. The data provided by Users is used by AMPZ to analyze the
          youth sports industry as a whole, and to connect Users with sports
          opportunities which may best apply to them. This can include, but is
          not limited to, Partner collaborations, detection events, training,
          deep learning, or special events.
          <br>
          <br>
        </dd>
        <dt>3. User Accounts</dt>
        <dd>
          3.1. In order to use the AMPZ Service, the User must create a user
          account by following the registration instructions in the AMPZ
          Service. The AMPZ Service credentials are personal. The User shall
          ensure that any user account credentials and equivalent information
          required to access the user account of the User are kept confidential
          and used in a secure manner not accessible by third parties. A User
          can have only one user account.
          <br>
          <br>
          3.2. Where it is suspected that any unauthorized person has become
          aware of a User’s user account credentials or has access to the user
          account of the User, the User shall immediately inform AMPZ thereof.
          The User shall be responsible for any use of the AMPZ Service and any
          activity under the user account of the User.
          <br>
          <br>
          3.3. In order to use the AMPZ Services, the User must input valid and
          accurate results and data to the best of their ability. The User
          agrees to adhere to these rules. The User is responsible to keep their
          data up to date and accurate, in order to benefit from any profiling,
          or opportunities from Partners or from AMPZ.
          <br>
          <br>
          3.4. Should a User not adhere to these terms of use, AMPZ may use its
          discretion to remove that account. If a User selects an identifier for
          their account or team page AMPZ reserves the right to edit, remove or
          reclaim it, if we believe it is inappropriate (such as a User name or
          a team name that does not closely relate to a User’s actual name, club
          or level).
          <br>
          <br>
        </dd>
        <dt>4. Data</dt>
        <dd>
          4.1. The purpose of utilizing the User’s or partner’s data will be in
          the spirit of benefitting youth sports as a whole, and the User
          themselves wherever possible.
          <br>
          <br>
          4.2. AMPZ will request data that is closely linked to 2.4, and will
          minimize excessive data collection.
          <br>
          <br>
          4.3. The onus is on the user and partner to ensure that their data is
          up to date and accurate via their inputs. From this, AMPZ will ensure
          that information stored will be accurate and up to date too.
          <br>
          <br>
          4.4. AMPZ shall store the data on Users for an unlimited period of
          time. This is to monitor progression over time, as well as to follow
          trends in youth sports as a whole. If the User does not agree with
          this, they may request for their account to be deleted
          <br>
          <br>
          4.5. AMPZ will take any reasonable steps to ensure that personal data
          is kept secure - against both external and internal threats.
          <br>
          <br>
          4.6. The data provided by Users and Partners to the AMPZ service may
          be accessed directly by third party providers. This data will not be
          made anonymous, and may be hosted on a third-party provider’s server.
          <br>
          <br>
          4.7. Furthermore, the User may at any period request that for a
          complete set of their data from AMPZ. In this case, the User should
          submit the request via email to info@AMPZ.tv. The company will provide
          the data to the user in a reasonable time period.
          <br>

        <dt>5. Partner Accounts</dt>
        <dd>
          5.1. In order to use the AMPZ Service, the applicable Partner
          Representative must accept the terms of use on behalf of the Partner.
          By accepting these terms of use, the Partner Representative accepts on
          behalf of the Partner itself. The Partner is then bound by the
          agreement.
          <br>
          <br>
          5.2. Upon agreeing to the terms of use, the Partner shall be required
          to activate their community of influencers, players, coaches, and
          other entities and encourage them to join the AMPZ Service.
          <br>
          <br>
          5.3. Once the agreed upon community is present on AMPZ, the Partner
          will then receive various benefits from AMPZ, including but not
          limited to an official Partner page on the AMPZ Service, data on the
          community’s performance, a personal account manager, co-hosting event
          opportunities, as well as access to AMPZ’s scouting team and
          resources.

          <br>
          <br>
          6.2. With this agreement, the User also accepts that AMPZ is only able
          to highlight players or coaches on which AMPZ has specific data. This
          means that the onus is on the User to ensure that their profile is up
          to date and correct.
          <br>
          <br>
          6.3. The opportunities created in order to highlight talent are at
          AMPZ’s complete discretion. AMPZ may take into account the User’s
          data, social presence, content, coach feedback, or any other measure
          in order to rate talent.
          <br>
          <br>
          6.4. AMPZ has developed its own algorithms to score talent. These
          algorithms may be adapted, and developed over time to ensure that this
          remains an accurate measure of talent.
          <br>
          <br>
